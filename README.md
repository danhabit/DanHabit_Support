# Welcome to DanHabit

### Discover DanHabit's Design Philosophy:

At DanHabit, our mission is to empower users to develop self-driven habits. We specialize in designing for repetitive tasks, offering flexible planning and adjustment options within a given time frame. Guided by the philosophy of "cultivating habits like training for marathon," we trust our users to take charge of their own planning and emphasize the importance of proactive action towards tasks rather than focusing solely on outcomes. Our app reduces user fear and resistance towards planning, providing a painless way to form healthy habits. 


### What we want you to do. 

    0. Plan your day in the morning and mark finished at night.
    0. Try not to fill your plan. Instead, start with something easy, then gradually raise your goal.
    0. If you don’t feel good, it’s ok to skip the plan. But always try first, and we will remind you in our app.
